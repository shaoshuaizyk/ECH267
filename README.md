# ECH267
Course Project For 2022 Winter ECH 267 

To obtain the results in my report, you need to change the: 
1. cost functions expression to change the scenario.s Shorter cost function is for the pure trajectory tracking while the longer one is additional with obstacle avoidance; 
2. initial conditions with heading north and heading northeast. Warning: starting from heading east could cause the failure of the solver and your computer might get stuck. 
3. Some parameters, like I mentioned in the report, the value of C, penalty of the speed error Q_e(4, 4), receding horizon M. By increasing those values, you could see the interesting result as I mentioned in the report. Happy playing with my messy code!
